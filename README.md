# React Web App
Just playing with react trying to create a WebApp. The CSS is a mess. I am expecting to be done with the front end in a couple of weeks and we will get to do some cool back end. I haven't decide on what tech I am going to be using, but will write here once I make my mind. 

# Test
To test this app execute the following commands. 
`npm install`
`npm start`

You will probably get some errors because I haven't uploaded the pictures. You will need to add your own pictures.
